# GuessingGame

In the classic Twenty Questions game, one person thinks of something--anything--and other
people try to guess the thing by asking yes or no questions to narrow down what sort of thing it
is. If they guess it in fewer than 20 questions, they win.

In this project, a person plays the 20 Questions game with the
computer. In this version of the game, the human thinks of something and the computer will try
to guess it. 

There are two versions of the 20 Questions guessing game. The first version has a
pre-specified set of questions, at least 16. The second version allows an unrestricted set of
things; it begins with the pre-specified set but allows the user to add questions to the set.
